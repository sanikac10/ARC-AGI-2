The background remains unchanged across input and output.\n2. The shape, orientation, and structure of the yellow '8' cluster also never change; its position is fixed.\n3. The green '2' cluster also retains its exact shape, color, and internal structure, but its position may change. Its internal arrangement is unmodified (no rotation/flipping).\n4. The primary difference is that in the output, the green cluster has relocated closer to the yellow cluster (usually it's adjacent, but never overlapping or diagonally placed).\n5.

The green cluster moves the minimal possible distance, preserving its full shape, required to become adjacent (sharing any edge) with the yellow cluster.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nGrid Structure and General Observations:\n- Every grid (input and output) is 11x11. The dimensions are always preserved, indicating a mapping transformation is applied without resizing or shifting the grid as a whole.\n- Each input grid contains a large number of different colored regions. Colors (represented by numbers) include 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8. There are also regions of homogeneous color (e.g., blocks of 5, sometimes in large rectangles at the bottom, and other blocks for other values). \n- The borders of each grid are not marked separately; all colored/numbered content is presented inside the main area.\n\nPatterns and Regions:\n- In the input, the bottom three rows of the grid frequently form a contiguous block of 5s (brown); this is never changed in output.\n- Above the bottom region, the grid is subdivided into smaller rectangular or square zones (patches) of various other values, seemingly arranged in a regular (tiled) grid.

Careful comparison reveals:\n    - Each color in the input grid is grouped into connected components (i.e., contiguous pixel \"blobs\").\n    - From these components, a single (usually the SMALLEST by area) object is selected.\n    - The output is then the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that contains this selected object/component, with all background and other regions inside this crop preserved as in input.\n- The crop is precise, tightly bounding the chosen object/component.\n- Objects/components not part of the selected region are absent from the output.\n- Which component is chosen? Always the one with the fewest cells (smallest area), regardless of color.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nGrid Properties:\n- Each input grid is significantly larger (11x12, 10x12, 12x12) than the paired output grid (5x3, 4x4, 3x5). Output grids are much smaller compared to their respective inputs and vary in height and width depending on the instance.\n- All grids are rectangular; output shapes are consistently smaller rectangles.\n\nColor and Value Roles:\n- In each input grid, the overwhelming majority of the cells are filled with the value '0' (blue). This is the background color for all input instances and is visually the dominant field.\n- A single contiguous (touching) group of non-background cells (e.g. color 1, 2, 8; orange, green, yellow) appears in each input.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nUniversal grid structure and palette:\n- All examples are 10x10 grids, with values representing different colors. The predominant value is 0 (blue), which acts as the background. Other colors appear as small rectangular blocks (segments of rows/columns) of various values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Each nonzero value forms its own colored region, with no mixed-color contiguous shapes.\n\nPattern and arrangement of non-background blocks:\n- Nonzero colors are placed linearly, either as individual pixels or as two or more adjacent pixels aligned in straight horizontal or vertical lines. These lines never bend or branch—each colored region is fully connected without gaps, and every nonzero zone (except the background) is a solid, uninterrupted run either within a row or within a column.\n- No two nonzero blocks of the same color are disconnected. Each colored object (block) is isolated from others of the same number.\n\nComparison: transformation from input to output:\n- For every unique color (except background/0), if it appears in a horizontal row or in a vertical column, the output transformation depends on whether the block is a complete, straight, gapless horizontal line.

Each output grid is much smaller, typically between 2x2 and 3x4.\n- The output grid from each pair is always much smaller than the input grid, and its size is not directly related to a fixed geometric operation on the input (e.g., not half or quartered), but instead appears to depend on a specific region within the input.\n\nColor and Pattern Roles:\n- Input grids feature multiple colors, each corresponding to a distinct integer value. Examples include 0 (deep blue, usually background), 1 (orange), 2 (green), 3 (red), 4 (purple), 6 (pink), 7 (grey), and 8 (yellow/olive).\n- Colors form highly contiguous, compact rectangular regions against a background of 0s. There are always multiple blocks/shapes of different colors, each block is a filled rectangle of a single color and does not touch other blocks (with the possible exception of some complex arrangements, but generally blocks are separated by background).\n\nComparing Inputs and Outputs:\n- For each pair, the output grid is composed entirely of a single color (all cells in the output have the same nonzero value). That color matches the fill color of one of the distinct rectangular regions in the input grid. Which color/region is chosen varies across the examples.\n- The output grid's size exactly matches the height and width of the selected filled rectangle (object) in the input grid. For example, a 3x4 filled region of 7s in the input becomes a 3x4 output of all 7; a 2x2 block of 4s in the input becomes a 2x2 grid of all 4 in the output.\n- No details about the object's location in the input are preserved; only the object's color and dimensions remain, as a fully-filled matrix of the same value.\n- Which object is chosen? Always the smallest (by area = height x width) colored rectangle in the input grid. If there are ties (more than one smallest region), a further tie-breaker (likely upper-leftmost, but may require more observations in other data) would be necessary.\n\nConstants and Variables:\n- The background color (0) and the arrangement of the other blocks do not contribute to output unless a background region is the smallest (not seen in given examples).\n- Only the smallest object's color and dimensions are relevant to output.\n\nSymmetry, Reflection, Frequency, Numerical Properties:\n- The positional symmetry, row/column reflection, or placement with...", "solution_code": "def solve(input_grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    from collections import Counter, deque\n\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    H, W = input_grid.shape\n    bg_color = Counter(input_grid.flatten()).most_common(1)[0][0]  # Most frequent\n    visited = np.zeros_like(input_grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    # 8-connectivity directions\n    dirs = [(-1,  0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1),\n            (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n\n    for i in range(H):\n        for j in range(W):\n            if input_grid[i][j] == bg_color or visited[i][j]:\n                continue\n            color = input_grid[i][j]\n            q = deque([(i, j)])\n            indices = []\n            visited[i][j] = True\n            while q:\n                x, y = q.popleft()\n                indices.append((x, y))\n                for dx, dy in dirs:\n                    nx, ny = x+dx, y+dy\n                    if 0 <= nx < H and 0 <= ny < W and not visited[nx][ny] and input_grid[nx][ny]==color:\n                        visited[nx][ny] = True\n                        q.append((nx, ny))\n            rows = [x for x, y in indices]\n            cols = [y for x, y in indices]\n            min_r, max_r = min(rows), max(rows)\n            min_c, max_c = min(cols), max(cols)\n            height = max_r - min_r + 1\n            width = max_c - min_c + 1\n            area = height * width\n            objects.append({'color': color, 'h': height, 'w': width, 'area': area, 'min_r': min_r, 'min_c': min_c, 'indices': indices})\n\n    # Find the object with minimal area\n    smallest = min(objects, key=lambda obj: obj['area'])\n    color, h, w = smallest['color'], smallest['h'], smallest['w']\n    return [[color for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]", "id": "23b5c85d", "split": "train", "image": "/Users/sanikachavan/Downloads/ARC-AGI/ARC-AGI-2/data/data/results/arcagi2-sft-v0/Data_Images/23b5c85d_image.png", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an ARC-AGI puzzle solver.

Output grids are always a single (1x1) cell.\n\nColor/Value Usage and Object Distinction:\n- Each input uses two or more distinct values (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 5, 8) to create visible shapes or patterns. These numbers represent colors, but their specific meanings vary by task instance; only spatial and value relationships matter.\n- In all cases, the number 0 is present and often acts as a background or dividing line, but not always exclusively so. Other numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) form objects in the grid. \n- Output grids (1x1) contain a single number in each, which is not always present in the input grid itself.\n\nPattern and Transformation Observations:\n- The number displayed in each output does not directly match the most common value in the input, nor is it just the background value.\n- Close observation shows that each input grid is partitioned into contiguous regions of the same non-zero value, often with each contiguous group considered an 'object'. These objects can form blocks, crosses, corners, or other arrangements defined by adjacency.\n- The output value always corresponds to the count (number) of contiguous non-background objects of any non-zero color/number in the input, and then maps this count to a unique output color/number according to a specific rule.\n- The same output number/color can appear for different arrangements if the object count matches (e.g., several grids produce the same output if their object count is the same, regardless of their positions or values).\n- Grid color usage does not impact the output directly; only the number of separate contiguous groups ('objects') matters.\n\nNumerical, Shape, and Contiguity Patterns:\n- Objects are generally defined as cells sharing the same value and touching orthogonally or diagonally (possibly based on the code’s adjacency method), and separated by 0 or another value.\n- Outputs from the input-object pairs follow this template:\n   -- If 1 object: output 2\n   -- If 4 objects: output 3\n   -- If 5 objects: output 6\n   -- If 6 objects: output 1\n- The color chosen for the output (the value in the 1x1 cell) encodes this mapping.

No other colors appear.\n\nBackground & Border:\n- The outer border is made up of a single layer, consisting of 8 (yellow) on the top and left/bottom edges, and 2 (green) on the bottom and right edges. The 8 and 2 values form a solid unbroken frame around the entire grid. This frame does not change from input to output. \n- The inner part of the grid is predominantly filled with 0 (dark blue), but regions adjacent to or in line with the yellow (8) and green (2) borders may also be affected.\n\nTransformation Patterns (from Input → Output):\n- In the outputs, a red (3) region appears inside the blue (0) area. This region is always in a horizontal and a vertical band (both red and about two cell strips wide) crossing the grid.\n- The location of these bands always aligns with rows and columns where the count of 0s (blue) in that row or column is exactly two less than the width/height of the matrix. (That is, for an NxN grid, there are N-2 blue cells in that row/column.)\n- The red (3) fills the contiguous stretch of blue (0) in the target row or column, but does not overwrite any other value (the border and any green/yellow remain unaltered).\n- The union of these row(s) and column(s) forms a cross shape. The cross sections are always centered on rows/columns based on the count-of-0 property just described.\n- If multiple rows or columns fit this property, all are marked.\n\nSymmetry and Relationships:\n- The transformation is always symmetric with respect to the center of the band (the cross forms a trophy-like cross, not a diagonal or offset T).\n- The intersection of the vertical and horizontal bands does not take precedence over either band; no value is promoted, demoted, or replaced. Where both bands overlap, only red (3) appears in output.\n- The colored bands never go beyond the region of the inner blue area, and never replace the border.\n\nNumerics and Conditional Rules:\n- The rule operates strictly dependent on counting the number of blue (0) cells in each row and column – only those whose count is N-2 are chosen for conversion to red within their contiguous blue (0) stretches.\n- No changes are made to 2 (green) or 8 (yellow) in the interior, aside from being preserved as borders. \n- If t...", "solution_code": "import numpy as np\n\ndef solve_2bee17df(input_mat):\n    input_mat = np.array(input_mat)\n    output_mat = input_mat.copy()\n    H, W = input_mat.shape\n    special_rows = [i for i in range(H) if sum(input_mat[i, j] == 0 for j in range(W)) == W-2]\n    special_cols = [j for j in range(W) if sum(input_mat[i, j] == 0 for i in range(H)) == H-2]\n    for i in range(H):\n        for j in range(W):\n            if (i in special_rows or j in special_cols) and input_mat[i, j] == 0:\n                output_mat[i, j] = 3\n    return output_mat", "id": "2bee17df", "split": "train", "image": "/Users/sanikachavan/Downloads/ARC-AGI/ARC-AGI-2/data/data/results/arcagi2-sft-v0/Data_Images/2bee17df_image.png", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an ARC-AGI puzzle solver.

The side length of each output always matches the number of rows of the input, i.e., an input of size (H x W) yields an output of size (H x H).\n\nParsing and Identifying Grid Patterns:\n- The input grids are visually and numerically partitioned into blocks of equal width. For example:\n  * In the 4x12 case: The input's width (12) is exactly three times its height (4), making 3 blocks of size 4x4.\n  * In the 3x9 case: 9 = 3 x 3, so the input is split into 3 blocks of size 3x3.\n  * In the 2x6 case: 6 = 3 x 2, so the input is split into 3 blocks of size 2x2.\n\nColor/Number Distribution:\n- Input grids contain a variety of different numbers/colors, typically ranging from 0 through some maximum (values visible such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n- The output grid for each example contains only the values from one of the input's blocks: specifically, always the first segment/block of size HxH from the input.\n- There are no value alterations or rearrangements within these blocks: the cell colors/numbers are preserved exactly as they occur within their block in the input.\n\nChanges vs. Constants:\n- What changes: The total area is reduced from a wide grid to a square, and all content outside the first block is discarded.\n- What remains constant: Values/patterns within the first block are preserved totally.

For example:\\n  * In the 4x12 case: The input's width (12) is exactly three times its height (4), making 3 blocks of size 4x4.\\n  * In the 3x9 case: 9 = 3 x 3, so the input is split into 3 blocks of size 3x3.\\n  * In the 2x6 case: 6 = 3 x 2, so the input is split into 3 blocks of size 2x2.\\n\\nColor/Number Distribution:\\n- Input grids contain a variety of different numbers/colors, typically ranging from 0 through some maximum (values visible such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\\n- The output grid for each example contains only the values from one of the input's blocks: specifically, always the first segment/block of size HxH from the input.\\n- There are no value alterations or rearrangements within these blocks: the cell colors/numbers are preserved exactly as they occur within their block in the input.\\n\\nChanges vs. Constants:\\n- What changes: The total area is reduced from a wide grid to a square, and all content outside the first block is discarded.\\n- What remains constant: Values/patterns within the first block are preserved totally. No colors are changed or mixed, and no rotations, reflections, or flips occur.\\n\\nSymmetry, Ratios, and Divisibility:\\n- The input width is always a multiple of the input height, forming an exact integer number of square partitions.\\n- Only the first square block (columns 0 to H-1 for each row, where H is the input height) is retained.\\n\\nFrequency and Exceptions:\\n- There are no exceptions or deviations between examples: always a three-way partition (as demonstrated by 3 test cases), and always only the first block is output.\\n\\nPattern:\\n- The core transformation is: Divide the input grid horizontally into equal-sized square blocks (each of height H and width H, where H is the number of rows/height), and output only the first square block (top-left corner of the input).\\n- There is no element-by-element operation or color-related logic except by block extraction.\\n\\nGeneralization:\\n- This rule can be applied to any grid where width is a multiple o...\", \"code\": \"def extract_first_square_block(input_mat):\\n    H = len(input_mat)\\n    return tuple(row[:H] for row in input_mat)\"}"}]}

This stripe lies at exactly the same place in both input and output, always located in the 5th column (index 4) of the grid and spanning all rows.\\n- The leftmost (first) four columns contain a compact block of colorful cells (values not zero or one), with varying content in each example. This left block always involves a 3x4 or 4x4 region densely filled with numbers other than 0 or 1.\\n- The rest of the grid (right of the brown stripe and below/above the left block) is mostly blue (0), except for a handful of isolated orange (1) squares sparsely scattered.\\n\\nComparison of input and output:\\n- The orange 1s present in various places in the blue region remain totally unchanged in value and position from input to output.\\n- The left colored block is entirely replicated in the output. However, in the output, this block's pattern is also spread in two additional places: to the right of the brown stripe and below the initial region.\\n- In all outputs, it is clear that the left colored block is reproduced at three quadrants: upper left (original), upper right (mirrored across the brown stripe), and lower left (shifted downward beneath the original), forming an L-shaped pattern in the non-blue area.\\n- The brown stripe itself is copied verbatim—there are never changes to it.\\n\\nTransformation and pattern logic:\\n- In detail, the non-blue, non-orange block at the top left of the grid serves as a template or stamp, which is used to \\\"tile\\\" or replicate itself into up to three regions:\\n    * The initial position (original).\\n    * A position mirrored horizontally across the brown stripe (starting in the sixth column, directly horizontally aligned with the original location to its right).\\n    * A position mirrored vertically beneath the original (starting in the sixth row, vertically aligned below the top block, but still left of the brown stripe).\\n- All cells in the output corresponding to these template r...\", \"code\": \"def solve_grid(input_mat):\\n    from copy import deepcopy\\n    output_mat = deepcopy(input_mat)\\n    # Step 1: Extract the template block (assumed always the top-left 4x4 grid)\\n    template = [row[:4] for row in input_mat[:4]]\\n    # Step 2: Positions to stamp the template (found by analyzing examples)\\n    positions = [(0, 0), (0, 6), (5, 0)]\\n    for row_off, col_off in positions:\\n        for i in range(4):\\n            for j in range(4):\\n                out_r, out_c = row_off + i, col_off + j\\n                if input_mat[out_r][out_c] == 5:\\n                    continue  # never overwrite the brown bar\\n                output_mat[out_r][out_c] = template[i][j]\\n    return output_mat\"}"}]}

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the Images\n\nGrid Structure & Dimensions:\n- Each input grid is always 14x14 (square), while each output grid is always 3x3 (also square).\n- The output is not simply a crop or zoom of the input, but a downsampled, summarized version mapping from the larger input to a much smaller output.\n\nColor/Value Mapping Overview:\n- Four distinct types of cell values appear across the inputs:\n  - 0 (blue): Background, fills the majority of cells, always largest area.\n  - 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 (other colors): These numbers cluster and never appear as isolated singletons; each forms a visually distinguishable block (either single contiguous area or tightly grouped region).\n- Each input contains several such distinct blocks of nonzero values, each block never touches another.\n \nSpatial Relationships & Block Structures:\n- Each non-background (i.e., nonzero) color forms a contiguous cluster, often in familiar shapes (cross, block, compact group). Each color's blocks are visually isolated from blocks of other colors and from the edge.\n- The clusters are of nearly the same size and shape within each input, and multiple clusters of the same color may appear in a grid.\n \nInput-to-Output Transformation Analysis:\n- The output grid (3x3) is not a direct copy but encodes summary information:\n  - Each cell in the 3x3 output grid corresponds to a particular region (subgrid) of the 14x14 input. There are nine such regions, suggesting a partitioning of the large grid into a 3x3 regularly spaced lattice.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nGeneric Description of Input Grids:\n- Each input grid is a 2D rectangular array of integers, visually represented as colored grids. The integer values are consistent within each region/object.\n- The grids are composed of a majority background (typically the color/value 0, blue here) and several larger rectangular regions of a single color/value (such as green/2, red/3, brown/5, purple/4, pink/6, yellow/8, gray/7).\n- All colored regions/objects in these examples have uniform fill: they are solid rectangles containing only one value. Different objects can be present in the same grid with different colors/values.\n- Rectangular colored regions are always fully surrounded on all sides by the blue (0) background, and never touch the grid’s edges.\n\nGeneric Description of Output Grids:\n- The output grids retain the exact same dimensions and background values (0/blue) as the input.\n- Each colored object in the output grid remains a rectangle of the same size, position, and color as in the input.\n- The key transformation is that for every colored rectangle, all interior cells (those not on the rectangle’s outermost edge) are replaced by the background value (0).

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nGeneral Structure and Color Roles:\n- Each input grid consists of multiple colored regions, with up to five colors appearing (0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc.), depending on the grid.\n- Outputs are always a larger grid (input increases by a scale of 3× in both dimensions: a 5x5 input produces a 15x15 output, 10x10 from a 5x5, 20x20 from a 5x5, etc.).\n- The outputs maintain and expand the spatial arrangement of the input regions, including backgrounds and foregrounds, making each colored square in the input become a larger square or rectangle of that color in the output.\n\nScaling and Repetition Patterns:\n- Every input pixel is replaced with a 3x3 block of same-value pixels in the output. Thus, a k×k input region becomes a (3k)×(3k) block.\n- This scaling is uniform for all colors (background as well as non-background).\n- The relative location of each region is preserved (no shifts, rotations, or reflections).

The borders are always filled with a single color (value 0, blue), forming a uniform background.\n\nColor and Object Roles:\n- The image contains one dominant background color (0, blue) and two (sometimes three) other colors forming distinct, contiguous patterns:\n  - Each non-background color forms a tight cluster (object) somewhere near the center or offset from center.\n  - Example colors: 3 (red), 8 (yellow), 2 (green), 4 (purple), 1 (orange). The color roles differ between instances but preserve object integrity between input and output.\n\nComparison Across Input and Output:\n- In every pair, the input presents a unique pattern made from one or more color objects, always strictly separated (no overlap), never touching the grid border.\n- The output preserves the spatial distribution of background and the original objects, but duplications and symmetries appear. Specifically:\n  - The original arrangement of colored shapes is expanded to produce a four-quadrant rotational symmetry (90-degree multiples), centered at the center of the grid.\n  - For each non-background object, three new instances are created, placed as if the original was rotated 90, 180, and 270 degrees about the grid center.\n  - The original is always preserved, and the three additional copies are placed at positions matching rotations around the grid center.\n  - Colors are preserved. Each color remains the same in each quadrant.\n\nSymmetry, Transformations, and Structure:\n- The central concept is 4-fold rotational symmetry about the center of the grid. Each unique non-background object is repeated via 90-degree, 180-degree, and 270-degree rotations.\n- Rotation center is the central cell (or, for even-sized grids, the center of the 2x2 or cross-shaped cells), with the arrangement visually balanced and symmetrical.\n- The objects do not overlap after duplication; instead, the outputs show that the instances are always separated.

It remains unchanged except in places where it is overwritten by the transformation.\n  - 6 (pink): Forms the outer layer ('border') of each square shape in the input.\n  - 4 (purple): Only present in the outputs, forming solid fills inside some (but not all) squares.

The area inside the innermost square is filled, and each facing band is exactly one cell wide.\\n- All other cells remain the background value (0/blue).\\n\\nConstancy and variance:\\n- The background and grid shape never change. The only thing that changes is which color is used for the bands, and this is determined by the color of the non-background cluster in the input.\\n- The arrangement of the input cluster does not affect the orientation or number of concentric squares—only the color does.\\n\\nSymmetry and structure:\\n- The output always displays perfect rotational and reflectional symmetry about the center—centered, concentric squares always.

Stays unchanged between input and output.\n- Value 4 (lavender): Forms connected clusters—these are solid shapes or blocks that can be squares or L-shapes. These clusters are never singletons; always some kind of patch.\n- Value 7 (brown/gray): Absent in input, only appears in the output, always in place of a previously 0 (blue) cell, never replacing 4s directly.\n\nComparative Observations Between Input and Output:\n- All patches of 4s remain unchanged in color and shape, i.e., are preserved exactly from input to output.\n- At certain positions directly adjacent to some 4-patches, some background cells (value 0) are changed to 7.\n- The location of each 7 is always immediately adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 4 (never diagonal adjacency unless also adjacent horizontally/vertically).\n- All 7s together form a single continuous block (with the 4s), i.e., they never appear isolated or split far from the cluster of 4s.\n- The placement of 7s follows a clear pattern: for each group of connected 4s (considering 8-connected neighbors), the positions that WERE 0 but are completely enclosed by the cluster's border are filled as 7.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nDimensions & Layout:\n- Every input and output grid here has dimensions 10x10. There is a direct cell-to-cell correspondence between input and output; no resizing, rotation, or overall re-alignment is performed.\n\nColor and Cell Value Roles:\n- The grids use several unique integer values, each mapped to a particular color in the visualization. Each training example uses a different palette, but in any one image typical colors (red, blue, orange, pink, etc.) correspond to specific integer values (e.g., 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Most of the grid is filled with one dominant background color/value (most frequently 0/blue), forming the 'empty' background.\n- The upper left 3x3 region within each grid contains a cluster of contiguous cells of the background value (0) and some other non-background values simulating a simple shape or mask. These cells are always located in the upper-left and bounded within the first three rows and columns.\n\nPatterns & Cluster Analysis:\n- Elsewhere in the grid, several contiguous clusters/objects of nonzero, non-background colors exist. Each such cluster comprises a contiguous shape made of one color/value, with no other such clusters of that color elsewhere in the grid.\n- These clusters exist in the foreground and are visually isolated from each other. The number, position, and color of clusters vary across tasks and have no obvious symmetry or repetition between examples, except that each color forms a contiguous patch per grid.\n\nComparisons: Input to Output\n- The clusters within the upper left 3x3 region are always retained exactly as in the input in the same positions and with the same cell values.\n- For the rest of the grid:\n  * All patches (objects) that have the property of being a shifted version (up to translation) of the NON-background cells in the upper-left 3x3 region are replaced in the output by the color '5' (brown), regardless of their input color.

There is a direct cell-to-cell correspondence between input and output; no resizing, rotation, or overall re-alignment is performed.\\n\\nColor and Cell Value Roles:\\n- The grids use several unique integer values, each mapped to a particular color in the visualization. Each training example uses a different palette, but in any one image typical colors (red, blue, orange, pink, etc.) correspond to specific integer values (e.g., 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

These cells are always located in the upper-left and bounded within the first three rows and columns.\\n\\nPatterns & Cluster Analysis:\\n- Elsewhere in the grid, several contiguous clusters/objects of nonzero, non-background colors exist. Each such cluster comprises a contiguous shape made of one color/value, with no other such clusters of that color elsewhere in the grid.\\n- These clusters exist in the foreground and are visually isolated from each other.

This significant size reduction is a consistent property, suggesting a cropping/scaling operation is involved.\n- Input grids are mostly filled with blue (number 0), which serves as the background color. Within each example there are clusters of non-background cells—these colored blocks have distinct values (6 & 4, or 3 & 7, or 1 & 3) and, importantly, do not touch each other.\n\nObjects, Colors, and Spatial Characteristics:\n- There are always two non-background blocks (“objects”) in the input grid:\n  - One is larger, dominating the central area.

If a 2x2 block contains exactly one non-zero, that value becomes the output.\\n- In blocks with multiple unique nonzero values, one is selected (the solution code determines this by a difference operation--see below).\\n\\nBehavior In The Code:\\n- The given code splits the grid vertically (lefthalf/righthalf), then horizontally (tophalf/bottomhalf), thus creating the 4 quadrants (topleft, bottomleft, topright, bottomright) which each represent the 2x2 blocks in their positions.\\n- The grids are then intersected with the set of nonzero indices (all positions that are not zero).\\n- The code reconstructs the 4x4 output by sequentially 'painting' these positions/quadrants onto the smaller grid.\\n\\nOther Visual Invariants:\\n- No color appears outside of allowable locations (no new colors are created or destroyed).\\n- There is no rotation or reflection; orientation is preserved.\\n- Output always maintains the same 4x4 structure, regardless of the input's inner pattern as long as it's 8x8.\\n- The mapping from input to output is both spatially local (each output relates directly to...\", \"code\": \"import numpy as np\\n\\ndef solve_75b8110e(input_mat):\\n    output = np.zeros((4,4), dtype=int)\\n    for i in range(4):\\n        for j in range(4):\\n            block = input_mat[2*i:2*i+2, 2*j:2*j+2]\\n            vals = block.flatten()\\n            nz = [v for v in [block[1,1], block[1,0], block[0,1], block[0,0]] if v != 0]\\n            if len(vals[vals != 0]) == 0:\\n                output[i,j] = 0\\n            elif len(set([v for v in vals if v != 0])) == 1:\\n                output[i,j] = nz[-1] if nz else 0\\n            else:\\n                output[i,j] = nz[0] if nz else 0\\n    return output\"}"}]}

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nGrid Size/Dimensions and General Layout:\n- Each input/output is a square matrix, sizes observed: 5x5, 3x3, 9x9. For each input-output pair, grid size is preserved and there is no resizing, rotation, or cropping.\n\nColor and Value Roles (from visual cues and code):\n- There are at most four non-background values: 0 (blue, background), 2 (green), 4 (purple), 6 (pink), and 9 (cyan/aqua). However, only one colored non-background cell/region (2, 6, or 9) appears per example.\n- In the input, there is always a single contiguous non-background block (a solid square block of a single color, 2, 6, or 9) placed somewhere in the upper half of the grid.\n- In the output, \n  - The original colored block is shifted down by exactly 1 row, maintaining both its shape and its column alignment.\n  - Vertical purple (4) stripes appear above each column that had a non-background cell in the shifted object.

In the output:\\n  - The 0's in the output always form continuous, axis-aligned lines (either horizontal or vertical) passing through the positions of the original 0's and reaching until they meet a border of the current segment (i.e., extend up to a segment boundary or grid edge), but *never crossing* into a segment of a different color.\\n  - Each original 0 induces two crossing lines (one horizontal, one vertical) except near the borders; these form a \\\"plus (+)\\\" shape inside its segment.\\n  - When multiple 0's are present in the same segment and their cross-extensions meet, the zeroes merge into a shared cross, i.e., the 0's flows overlap.\\n  - In the output, the original locations of the zeroes themselves are always still 0.\\n- There is never any extension of 0's _beyond_ the color-segment in which their base zero sits. The 0 lines halt exactly at the interface to any other color (segment) or grid edge.\\n- Non-0 cells that are crossed by a zero-line are always changed to 0.\\n\\nRecurring properties, symmetry, and conditionals:\\n- The pattern of extension is always axis-aligned; no diagonal movement.\\n- Lines are always maximal: they fill as far as possible until a color-boundary/segment-edge is reached.\\n- Vertical and horizontal extension is always separately determined from each 0—overlapping lines only reinforce the same value.\\n- There is never any change to the numbe...\", \"code\": \"def solve_cross_extensions(input_mat):\\n    H, W = len(input_mat), len(input_mat[0])\\n    output = [list(r) for r in input_mat]\\n    for i in range(H):\\n        for j in range(W):\\n            if input_mat[i][j] == 0:\\n                # Expand left\\n                k = j\\n                while k >= 0 and input_mat[i][k] == input_mat[i][j]:\\n                    output[i][k] = 0\\n                    k -= 1\\n                # Expand right\\n                k = j\\n                while k < W and input_mat[i][k] == input_mat[i][j]:\\n                    output[i][k] = 0\\n                    k += 1\\n                # Expand up\\n                k = i\\n                while k >= 0 and input_mat[k][j] == input_mat[i][j]:\\n                    output[k][j] = 0\\n                    k -= 1\\n                # Expand down\\n                k = i\\n                while k < H and input_mat[k][j] == input_mat[i][j]:\\n                    output[k][j] = 0\\n                    k += 1\\n    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in output)\"}"}]}

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\n---\nGeneral Overview:\n- The input grids are large and filled with a seemingly random assortment of colors/numbers—each color/number in the range 0-9. The inner, centrally located region tends to be dominated by a single value (like 4, 1, or 8), while the border and surroundings are highly multicolored.\n- The corresponding output grids are considerably smaller and each display a clear, highly regular structure: there are few colors (always just 2), arranged in a grid-like or cross/stripe pattern, usually with obvious symmetry and blocks.\n\nDimensions & Structure:\n- Inputs: 27x23, 17x23, 16x17 — always much larger than outputs, and rectangular (but not square).\n- Outputs: 10x9, 7x6, 6x8 — always much smaller than their respective inputs, shape ratio somewhat preserved but not strictly.\n- In all outputs, the entire grid is covered (no transparent/blank/missing spaces).\n\nColor and Number Properties:\n- Inputs contain all digits 0–9. The dominant color in the central region of each input corresponds to one of the two colors of the output.\n- The output uses only two (sometimes three if a border is present, which isn’t the case here) unique numbers/colors, regardless of how many are in the input.\n- The placement and frequency of each color are highly structured in the output, with repeated rectangular blocks and visible bands crossing each other, frequently with central rows/columns of the secondary color.\n\nTransformation Patterns (from Input to Output):\n- Central Extraction: The output seems to be a reduced-size, low-resolution representation of the central region of the input. The mapping is not a strict pixel-wise crop or resize, but a compression, summarizing large blocks of the input to a single cell in the output.\n- Grid/Block Averaging: Each output cell corresponds to a symmetrical region (a block) in the input. The actual color chosen for each output cell is not a direct copy, but instead seems to be the most common color (mode, majority) within the corresponding block in the input, or chosen by a special rule (e.g., the least/most frequent color, or perhaps the smallest/largest color in the block).\n- Regular Output Patterns: In all outputs, a regular pattern emerges—alternating color stripes horizontally/vertically, or a cross shape centered in the grid.

The inner, centrally located region tends to be dominated by a single value (like 4, 1, or 8), while the border and surroundings are highly multicolored.\\n- The corresponding output grids are considerably smaller and each display a clear, highly regular structure: there are few colors (always just 2), arranged in a grid-like or cross/stripe pattern, usually with obvious symmetry and blocks.\\n\\nDimensions & Structure:\\n- Inputs: 27x23, 17x23, 16x17 — always much larger than outputs, and rectangular (but not square).\\n- Outputs: 10x9, 7x6, 6x8 — always much smaller than their respective inputs, shape ratio somewhat preserved but not strictly.\\n- In all outputs, the entire grid is covered (no transparent/blank/missing spaces).\\n\\nColor and Number Properties:\\n- Inputs contain all digits 0–9. The dominant color in the central region of each input corresponds to one of the two colors of the output.\\n- The output uses only two (sometimes three if a border is present, which isn’t the case here) unique numbers/colors, regardless of how many are in the input.\\n- The placement and frequency of each color are highly structured in the output, with repeated rectangular blocks and visible bands crossing each other, frequently with central rows/columns of the secondary color.\\n\\nTransformation Patterns (from Input to Output):\\n- Central Extraction: The output seems to be a reduced-size, low-resolution representation of the central region of the input. The mapping is not a strict pixel-wise crop or resize, but a compression, summarizing large blocks of the input to a single cell in the output.\\n- Grid/Block Averaging: Each output cell corresponds to a symmetrical region (a block) in the input. The actual color chosen for each output cell is not a direct copy, but instead seems to be the most common color (mode, majority) within the corresponding block in the input, or chosen by a special rule (e.g., the least/most frequent color, or perhaps the smallest/largest color in the block).\\n- Regular Output Patterns: In all outputs, a regular pattern emerges—alternating color stripes horizontally/vertically, or a cross shape centered in the grid. There is high spatial regularity, and the regions are either solid or have abrupt boundaries.\\n- Dominant/Background Color: The background color in the output typically mat...\", \"code\": \"def solve_8731374e(I):\\n    x1 = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Find all objects\\n    x2 = argmax(x1, size)               # Largest object\\n    x3 = subgrid(x2, I)                 # Smallest box with the object\\n    x4 = height(x3)\\n    x5 = width(x3)\\n    x6 = vsplit(x3, x4)                 # Vertical splits (blocks)\\n    x7 = lbind(greater, 4)\\n    x8 = compose(x7, numcolors)\\n    x9 = sfilter(x6, x8)                # Only blocks with >4 colors\\n    x10 = merge(x9)\\n    x11 = rot90(x10)                    # Rotate for horizontal analysis\\n    x12 = vsplit(x11, x5)\\n    x13 = sfilter(x12, x8)\\n    x14 = merge(x13)                    # Combine interesting horizontal blocks\\n    x15 = rot270(x14)\\n    x16 = leastcolor(x15)               # Background: least common color\\n    x17 = ofcolor(x15, x16)\\n    x18 = fork(combine, vfrontier, hfrontier)\\n    x19 = mapply(x18, x17)              # Get indices for cross locations\\n    O = fill(x15, x16, x19)\\n    return O\"}"}]}

This rectangle is surrounded by a frame or border of another color for contrast, and the larger matrix surrounds these regions with a generally “busy” or heterogeneous background palette.\n- In several cases, the rectangular region may have a border or meet the border for most sides, but there is always at least one cell-width of background around the main core.\n\nInput-Output Change Analysis:\n- The vast majority of cells are unchanged between input and output.\n- The exception: there is a 1-cell wide frame or box surrounding the innermost rectangle region. In the output, this border is overwritten by a uniform color (the minimum/least frequent value of the palette in the entire grid, often the same color as the rectangle's interior but not always).\n- This overwriting creates a thicker boundary: the original internal rectangle stays the same, but a newly colored box/frame is placed directly around it (filling all eight sides: top, bottom, left, right and all four corners, forming a proper rectangle border).\n\nPattern and Detection:\n- To identify the region to apply this transformation:\n    - Find the largest rectangle area of a unique, locally-coherent color patch (where one color dominates, and does not appear as frequently elsewhere in the grid).\n    - This region is always completely surrounded by another color set (i.e., it is not adjacent to a matrix border).\n    - The transformation is applied only to the immediate surrounding layer—one cell thick—that directly neighbors the bounding box of the rectangle.\n- The fill value (for the border/frame) is always the least common color in the entire grid.

There is no cropping, rotation, resizing, or shifting—the transformation is always cell-to-cell.\\n- The color palette and their representing numbers vary between input sets, but each grid uses a small integer range (e.g., 0-4, 0-8, 0-3), with each integer visually mapped to a color.\\n- Each input-output pair shares an almost identical layout except for a subtle, localized transformation near the center.\\n\\nColor and Shape Roles:\\n- There is a distinct, coherent rectangular region of a particular color (typically appearing as the most isolated, least frequent color) placed somewhere within the input. This rectangle is surrounded by a frame or border of another color for contrast, and the larger matrix surrounds these regions with a generally “busy” or heterogeneous background palette.\\n- In several cases, the rectangular region may have a border or meet the border for most sides, but there is always at least one cell-width of background around the main core.\\n\\nInput-Output Change Analysis:\\n- The vast majority of cells are unchanged between input and output.\\n- The exception: there is a 1-cell wide frame or box surrounding the innermost rectangle region. In the output, this border is overwritten by a uniform color (the minimum/least frequent value of the palette in the entire grid, often the same color as the rectangle's interior but not always).\\n- This overwriting creates a thicker boundary: the original internal rectangle stays the same, but a newly colored box/frame is placed directly around it (filling all eight sides: top, bottom, left, right and all four corners, forming a proper rectangle border).\\n\\nPattern and Detection:\\n- To identify the region to apply this transformation:\\n    - Find the largest rectangle area of a unique, locally-coherent color patch (where one color dominates, and does not appear as frequently elsewhere in the grid).\\n    - This region is always completely surrounded by another color set (i.e., it is not adjacent to a matrix border).\\n    - The transformation is applied only to the immediate surrounding layer—one cell thick—that directly neighbors the bounding box of the rectangle.\\n- The fill value (for the border/frame) is always the least common color in the entire grid.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nGeneral Structure and Elements:\n- All input and output grids have the same fixed dimensions: 15 (rows) x 10 (columns).\n- The grids are primarily filled with three colors/numbers:\n    - 0 (dark blue): Acts as the background and the most frequent color.\n    - 8 (yellow-green): Forms flat rows, L-shapes, or clusters.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\n**Dimensions and Structure**\n- All input and output examples are 16x16 square grids, suggesting direct mapping between input and output.\n\n**Colors/Values and their Role:**\n- The grids use a wide palette in the input (dozens of distinct colors/numbers, from 0 through at least 9 or higher). In contrast, the output grid always contains only two colors/numbers: \n  * 0 (blue) fills almost the entire output, acting as the background/uniform fill.\n  * A contiguous region (a rectangle or geometric block) of a single color distinct from 0 (same as some contiguous block from the input) is preserved. The color for this block is not always the same: it may be 2 (green), 6 (pink), 7 (gray), etc., matching the largest block from the input.\n\n**Input-Output Comparison:**\n- Each input grid contains heavy noise: a background of 0 and many small blobs of different colors, along with one conspicuously large rectangular or nearly rectangular region where a single color is clustered more than anywhere else.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nDimensions and Patterns:\n- In every example, the input is a larger grid (14x16, 15x16, 15x15), and the output is a smaller grid (5x5, 6x6). There is always a reduction in size from input to output, suggesting cropping or extraction around a specific region of interest.\n- All inputs are dominated by a background color/value (0: deep blue). Embedded within this field are distinct colored blocky shapes, separated by large areas of background: each is a solid contiguous region with values such as 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. Most of these objects are rectangles or L-shapes, composed of a single value.\n\nColor Coding and Objects:\n- The various non-zero numbers indicate discrete objects – each number/group forms its own region. Objects exhibit uniform color internally (i.e., all '3', all '2', etc.).\n- Some objects directly touch or abut each other, while others are separated by at least one background cell.\n- The relative arrangement varies, but in each case there are at least two non-background groupings, and sometimes objects enclose or border each other.\n\nTransformation and Changes:\n- The output grids are always smaller than the input. The output appears to be a crop or subgrid extracted and recomposed from the input. In every output, we can find a miniaturized layout of the colored structures from the input, but never the full original size – only a sub-block that contains a group of objects (and often some space between them).

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nGrid Structure & Colors:\n- Every input and output is a square grid (examples: 15x15, 13x13, 16x16). Grid size is preserved between input and output.\n- Each cell contains a single integer, visually color-coded. Colors represent at least the following distinct values (by inspection): 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 9. Each color fills regions, lines, and scattered points. Orange (1) and blue-violet (0) are the most visually frequent.\n\nPatterns and Cell Function:\n- In the input, there is a visible mixture of all possible values. Some contiguous small blobs of the same value exist, and there are many scattered singletons for each color. \n- Output grids show a remarkable increase in the number of cells containing the value 1 (orange): large swathes of the grid, formerly multicolored, convert to 1. However, many colored elements (especially those making up narrow shapes) persist.\n- The value 0 (blue-violet) areas are nearly untouched between input and output; they seem invariant. \n\nTransformation Patterns:\n- From input to output, massive regions of the grid become 1, but these are never the original 0 regions, nor certain slender nonzero and non-1 shapes.\n- Nonzero connected components sometimes wholly transform to 1, sometimes they do not. However, individual nonzero pixels that are directly adjacent to a 0 region (sharing an edge, i.e., up/down/left/right but not diagonal) stay the same color; all other nonzero, non-0 regions become 1.\n\nSpatial Relationships:\n- Adjacency (not diagonal) matters greatly: only those nonzero colors directly touching (edge neighbors) a 0 region remain, everything else is recolored to 1.\n- This adjacency acts as a \"shield\" – only those colored regions that can \"touch\" a 0 survive; if they're isolated, or entirely surrounded by nonzero values, they are overridden by orange (1).\n\nWhat Remains Constant vs. What Transforms:\n- All 0-valued cells remain unchanged in position and color from input to output. Nonzero cells adjacent (N,S,E,W) to a 0 also retain their input value.\n- All other nonzero, non-adjacent cells switch to the value 1 in the output.

Grid size is preserved between input and output.\\n- Each cell contains a single integer, visually color-coded. Colors represent at least the following distinct values (by inspection): 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 9. Each color fills regions, lines, and scattered points. Orange (1) and blue-violet (0) are the most visually frequent.\\n\\nPatterns and Cell Function:\\n- In the input, there is a visible mixture of all possible values. Some contiguous small blobs of the same value exist, and there are many scattered singletons for each color. \\n- Output grids show a remarkable increase in the number of cells containing the value 1 (orange): large swathes of the grid, formerly multicolored, convert to 1. However, many colored elements (especially those making up narrow shapes) persist.\\n- The value 0 (blue-violet) areas are nearly untouched between input and output; they seem invariant. \\n\\nTransformation Patterns:\\n- From input to output, massive regions of the grid become 1, but these are never the original 0 regions, nor certain slender nonzero and non-1 shapes.\\n- Nonzero connected components sometimes wholly transform to 1, sometimes they do not. However, individual nonzero pixels that are directly adjacent to a 0 region (sharing an edge, i.e., up/down/left/right but not diagonal) stay the same color; all other nonzero, non-0 regions become 1.\\n\\nSpatial Relationships:\\n- Adjacency (not diagonal) matters greatly: only those nonzero colors directly touching (edge neighbors) a 0 region remain, everything else is recolored to 1.\\n- This adjacency acts as a \\\"shield\\\" – only those colored regions that can \\\"touch\\\" a 0 survive; if they're isolated, or entirely surrounded by nonzero values, they are overridden by orange (1).\\n\\nWhat Remains Constant vs. What Transforms:\\n- All 0-valued cells remain unchanged in position and color from input to output. Nonzero cells adjacent (N,S,E,W) to a 0 also retain their input value.\\n- All other nonzero, non-adjacent cells switch to the value 1 in the output.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nGrid Dimensions and Layout:\n- In all input-output pairs, the grid size is unchanged between input and output, which means the mapping is cell-to-cell and the transformation does not alter the overall structure or the size.\n- The shown examples are 8x8 and 12x12 grids.\n\nColors, Symbols, and Semantic Roles:\n- There are three different values (and thus, three colors):\n  - 0 (blue): This is the background color, covering the bulk of the grid. It frames and separates the other patterns and is never changed by the transformation.\n  - 2 (green): Forms closed or nearly-closed, contiguous rectilinear blocks (rectangles, squares, L-shapes), including outlines. These often form the border or boundaries of notable regions in the grid.\n  - 1 (orange): Only appears in output images. It fills complete, solid rectilinear regions, always entirely enclosed within green (2) boundaries and never touches the green directly at the edge (always surrounded by it). This color highlights the internal area enclosed by green paths.\n\nPattern Structure:\n- The green shapes (2s) form distinct, fully enclosed loops, rectangles, or spiral regions on the grid. They do not touch or cross themselves. Occasionally, these green lines enclose a region of blue zeros, or have a blue zero in the middle, which is allowed if the green forms a continuous perimeter around the zero(s).\n- The blue regions (0s) fill the grid except where the green shapes are present.\n\nTransformation Observations:\n- In the output, all regions that are fully enclosed by green borders (2s) are filled with color 1 (orange).\n- If the inner area enclosed by green borders contains green 2s (i.e. forms a smaller box/loop inside a larger one), only the area that is strictly inside and not itself a boundary remains filled with 1.

It frames and separates the other patterns and is never changed by the transformation.\\n  - 2 (green): Forms closed or nearly-closed, contiguous rectilinear blocks (rectangles, squares, L-shapes), including outlines. These often form the border or boundaries of notable regions in the grid.\\n  - 1 (orange): Only appears in output images. It fills complete, solid rectilinear regions, always entirely enclosed within green (2) boundaries and never touches the green directly at the edge (always surrounded by it). This color highlights the internal area enclosed by green paths.\\n\\nPattern Structure:\\n- The green shapes (2s) form distinct, fully enclosed loops, rectangles, or spiral regions on the grid. They do not touch or cross themselves. Occasionally, these green lines enclose a region of blue zeros, or have a blue zero in the middle, which is allowed if the green forms a continuous perimeter around the zero(s).\\n- The blue regions (0s) fill the grid except where the green shapes are present.\\n\\nTransformation Observations:\\n- In the output, all regions that are fully enclosed by green borders (2s) are filled with color 1 (orange).\\n- If the inner area enclosed by green borders contains green 2s (i.e. forms a smaller box/loop inside a larger one), only the area that is strictly inside and not itself a boundary remains filled with 1. So, nested regions also get their internal areas filled, respecting the nesting.\\n- Blue areas that are not fully surrounded by green, or that are outside (not inside any green enclosure), remain unchanged.\\n- The green boundary itself is never converted to orange and is never overwritten.

This diagonal's exact path changes from one pair to the next.\\n- In outputs:\\n    - The output grid is entirely free of 5s; every cell that was 5 is replaced by 0 (background).\\n    - The color that used to be the auxiliary color (2, 7, or 9) is now propagated to positions previously occupied by the 5s, but not exactly copying the 5's shape. Instead, the auxiliary color is extended diagonally beyond its original input positions such that it forms a perfect contiguous diagonal path (in both left-right and up-down directions). \\n    - This process is equivalent to \\\"completing\\\" or \\\"connecting\\\" the original diagonal of auxiliary color through/beyond where the 5s were, in both upward-right and downward-left directions from the diagonal break, filling in all those cells.\\n    - The auxiliary color now forms the only non-background feature in the grid, stretching from one edge to the other at a constant step in both i and j (i.e., the main diagonal and its parallel neighbors, depending on the input's 5-shape width).\\n    - Any cell not on the diagonal is set to background color 0.\\n\\nInvariance and Conditional Logic:\\n- The starting and ending corners of the diagonals (where the auxiliary color was originally present) are preserved in the outputs.\\n- The pattern is consistent: the diagonal is extended through positions previously occupied by 5s, but only along two directions:\\n    - up-ri...\", \"code\": \"def solve_general(input_mat):\\n    H, W = len(input_mat), len(input_mat[0])\\n    # 1.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nOverall Structure & Format:\n- Every input grid is a large matrix (either 16x14 or 14x14), dominated by a background of blue (0) and brown (5), with several colored blocks of distinct values (primarily 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n- Every output grid is a much smaller matrix of size 9x9. This change in size is a major transformation, so the main solution must include cropping, resizing, or content extraction.\n- The relative positions and contents of the colored blocks, their spatial relationships, and their color associations carry over through the transformation, but appear shifted, resized, and re-colored in a consistent, rule-based way.\n\nColor, Patterns, and Value Roles:\n- Blue (0): Background, filling all space outside blocks; completely absent from the output.\n- Brown (5): Large contiguous rectangles/sites inside the blue background, form the zones in which other colored blocks are placed. In the output, brown fills the main central area.\n- Colored blocks (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9): Isolated, solid rectangular or square islands embedded within brown. These are the main objects of interest.

Otherwise, the green fills only the single bar's orthogonal direction.\\n\\nNumerical and Visual Properties:\\n- The green (2) always overwrites red (3) and never overwrites blue (0).\\n- Green (2) lines always terminate at the ends of their red bars (no green appears on the blue background).\\n- If multiple green lines overlap at an intersection, the output remains green there (not reset to red).\\n- The transformation for each green (2) cell is independent and does not merge neighboring or parallel bars unless their green-filling overlaps spatially.\\n\\nComponent Identification:\\n- The probl...\", \"code\": \"import numpy as np\\n\\ndef solve(input_mat):\\n    output = np.copy(input_mat)\\n    H, W = input_mat.shape\\n\\n    # Step 1: Find bars (horizontal and vertical runs of red)\\n    bars = []\\n    # Horizontal bars\\n    for i in range(H):\\n        j = 0\\n        while j < W:\\n            if input_mat[i, j] == 3:\\n                start = j\\n                while j < W and input_mat[i, j] == 3:\\n                    j += 1\\n                end = j\\n                bars.append({'type': 'horizontal', 'coords': [(i, k) for k in range(start, end)]})\\n            else:\\n                j += 1\\n    # Vertical bars\\n    for j in range(W):\\n        i = 0\\n        while i < H:\\n            if input_mat[i, j] == 3:\\n                start = i\\n                while i < H and input_mat[i, j] == 3:\\n                    i += 1\\n                end = i\\n                bars.append({'type': 'vertical', 'coords': [(k, j) for k in range(start, end)]})\\n            else:\\n                i += 1\\n\\n    # Step 2: For each bar, check if it contains green (2)\\n    for bar in bars:\\n        if any(input_mat[i, j] == 2 for (i, j) in bar['coords']):\\n            for (i, j) in bar['coords']:\\n                output[i, j] = 2\\n    return output\"}"}]}

These include (with variation across examples):\\n    * Green (2), Yellow (8), Orange (1), Lavender (4), Pink (3), Red (6).\\n- Each cluster/object is surrounded by the background and does not touch other clusters or the edge of the grid.\\n\\nPatterns and Positions:\\n- Each cluster or object in the input can be mapped to a visually similar but not always identical object in the output.\\n- The position of the primary color drops remains constant from input to output (e.g., the green cluster in the lower left stays at the same coordinates).\\n\\nComparison of Input vs Output (Transformations):\\n- In the output, additional cells are filled around existing clusters, expanding them in a regular geometric fashion:\\n   * Expansion takes place along one axis (horizontal or vertical) — specifically, for every cluster, the output fills a continuous run (a bar) of cells that stretches from the cluster’s edge, in line with the long or short side of the object (depending on object’s orientation and colors).\\n   * The expansion always uses the dominant color of the object (its color in the input).\\n   * If other colored points are already present in the expansion region, these are preserved, not overwritten.\\n- In the cases where a single cell appears in the input, the output creates a bar (run of filled cells) along a straight line, passing through that cell.\\n- For objects with mixed colors (such as a cluster containing red, orange, and yellow), the output often creates several thickened bars each with a consistent color, usually determined by local groupings in the object.\\n- Where an object contains more than one color, the output runs have uniform colors matching the region or the axis.\\n- No new clusters are created; all transformations are expansions, not duplications or new shapes.\\n\\nSymmetry and Spatial Relationships:\\n- Expansion typically respects the object’s orientation: for rectangular objects, the bar aligns with the main axis of the rectangle.\\n- The expansion does not jump or cross background; it is a...\", \"code\": \"import numpy as np\\nfrom scipy.ndimage import label\\n\\ndef find_objects(input_mat):\\n    obj_mask = input_mat != 0\\n    labeled, n = label(obj_mask)\\n    clusters = []\\n    for k in range(1, n+1):\\n        coords = np.argwhere(labeled == k)\\n        colors = set(input_mat[tuple(coords.T)])\\n        min_r, min_c = coords.min(axis=0)\\n        max_r, max_c = coords.max(axis=0)\\n        cluster_coords = [tuple(c) for c in coords]\\n        clusters.append({\\n            'bbox': (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c),\\n            'coords': cluster_coords,\\n            'color_map': {(r,c): input_mat[r,c] for (r,c) in cluster_coords}\\n        })\\n    return clusters\\n\\ndef group_by_row_or_col(coords, orientation):\\n    from collections import defaultdict\\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\\n    if orientation == 'hor':\\n        for r,c in coords:\\n            groups[r].append((r,c))\\n        return [{'indices': v, 'color': None} for k,v in groups.items()]\\n    else:\\n        for r,c in coords:\\n            groups[c].append((r,c))\\n        return [{'indices': v, 'color': None} for k,v in groups.items()]\\n\\n\\ndef expand_bars(input_mat):\\n    mat = np.array(input_mat)\\n    output = mat.copy()\\n    clusters = find_objects(mat)\\n    for cluster in clusters:\\n        bbox = cluster['bbox']\\n        coords = cluster['coords']\\n        color_map = cluster['color_map']\\n        min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = bbox\\n        height = max_r - min_r + 1\\n        width = max_c - min_c + 1\\n        orientation = 'hor' if width >= height else 'ver'\\n        colormap_grouped = {}\\n        # Find dominant color per axis/group\\n        if orientation == 'hor':\\n            for r in range(min_r, max_r+1):\\n                row_colors = [color_map.get((r, c), 0) for c in range(min_c, max_c+1)]\\n                # Use most frequent color in row from existing object cells\\n                vals = [color_map.get((r,c)) for c in range(min_c,max_c+1) if (r,c) in color_map]\\n                if vals:\\n                    color = max(set(vals), key=vals.count)\\n                    for c in range(min_c, max_c+1):\\n                        if output[r, c] == 0:\\n                            output[r,c] = color\\n        else:\\n            for c in range(min_c, max_c+1):\\n                col_colors = [color_map.get((r, c), 0) for r in range(min_r, max_r+1)]\\n                vals = [color_map.get((r,c)) for r in range(min_r,max_r+1) if (r,c) in color_map]\\n                if vals:\\n                    color = max(set(vals), key=vals.count)\\n                    for r in range(min_r, max_r+1):\\n                        if output[r,c] == 0:\\n                            output[r,c] = color\\n    return output\"}"}]}

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nGrid Dimensions and Color Structure:\n- The grids vary in size: (e.g. 5x5, 7x7, 3x3) and are always square for the given examples.\n- Each grid uses several distinct integer values (which map to unique colors): zero is always blue (background), and other numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8) each appear in specific regions or patterns. \n\nSpatial/Structural Patterns:\n- In every input, the bottom row or bottom-most cells are filled with a single or dual-color stripe/band that spans most or all of the row/width. The color of this band differs between examples, but within a given example, it is consistent across the row (e.g. all 6, 8, 2, or 4).\n- Just above this stripe, there is typically a filled block or bar, either horizontally or vertically oriented, possibly of a different color.\n- The rest of the cells, mostly above the colored regions, are filled with zeros (blue).\n- In the output, the bands and bars present in the input retain their positions and values; their locations, scale, and values remain unchanged between input and output.\n\nChanges/Transformations (Input to Output):\n- The primary transformation affects the background (zero/blue) area above the nonzero core pattern.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\n Grid Makeup, Colors, and Spatial Structure:\n- The grids are all 12x12. There is no resizing, cropping, or rotation – every cell in the input maps directly to its corresponding cell in the output by row and column.\n- There are four distinct color codes used: 0 (blue), 5 (brown), 6 (pink), 7 (gray), 8 (yellow). Their spatial relationships and groupings are key to the rules:\n    * 0 (blue): Fills the background of the grid, remaining unaffected by any transformation.\n    * 5 (brown): Forms perfect hollow squares – each square is a closed frame of width 1, optionally with other cells or space inside.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nDimensions and structure:\n- The input grids are large squares: 26x26, 24x24, and 28x28. The output grids are all standardized to 7x7. Thus, the output is always a fixed size regardless of input size.\n\nPatterns and colors:\n- Each input grid consists of small colored numbers (which map to colors). The colors and numbers vary across the image. There does not appear to be a consistent color arrangement throughout the entire grid; rather, the grids look like a patchwork of many rectangles and regions of different numbers/colors.\n- The output grids each contain multiple colors but consist of solid, square-ish regions, often symmetric, with relatively regular shapes/patterns (contrasting the input's irregularity).\n- In every input grid, there is one noticeably distinct, solidly-colored rectangle embedded within the noisy grid. This rectangle is always 7x7 in size, and contains more structure and symmetry (e.g., similar numbers, repeated patterns) than its chaotic surroundings.\n\nInput-output comparison:\n- The output grid is a 7x7 grid that seems to exactly match the numbers (color values) and arrangement of numbers/pixels in that uniquely structured 7x7 square from the input.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nGrid Dimensions and Structure:\n- All input and output grids are 3x3, ensuring transformations are local (no resizing, cropping, or translation at grid level).\n\nColor/Number Analysis:\n- Each matrix has a background color (blue/0 in all shown cases), and non-background regions consist of contiguous blocks of a single color, sometimes surrounded partially or with other colored blocks adjacent.\n- Non-background numbers/colors (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8) appear in single blocks occupying one or more cells, forming clear contiguous shapes. Each block represents an ‘object’—a region of the grid filled with a single color.\n- Some colors (such as 0) are used as background and are not part of any operations.\n\nComparing Input vs Output:\n- In each example, the background (0/blue) and the shapes/blocks remain in their original positions—there is no translation, scaling, or mirroring.\n- The visual difference is that for each non-background colored block, the color propagates (or fills) downward: the color fills directly below each segment of the block, covering any cells below with that color until another object or grid edge stops propagation.\n- This means the output has blocks of color extending straight down from their original locations, forming vertical bands beneath each part of the block.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nGrid Structure and Color Palette:\n- All examples are grids with 3 rows and variable columns (10, 12, 13, 14), so the shape is always 3xN.\n- There are three cell values used (with corresponding colors):\n  - 0 (blue): The most frequent value, acting as the background and forming most of each grid.\n  - 5 (brown): Spaced throughout, typically appearing in one or more adjacent columns across the three rows, but never filling a whole row.\n  - 3 (red): Only appears in the output grids, replacing certain brown cells based on some rule.\n\nInput-Output Comparison:\n- All brown (5) cells in the input may remain as 5 in output or be replaced with 3, depending on their position.\n- Blue (0) background regions are never changed.\n- Output grids never introduce 5s in positions where there were none in the input; brown is only either retained or swapped for red.\n- Red (3) cells in the output appear only in positions that corresponded to brown (5) cells in the input.\n- Red cells always appear in the first and/or last columns (vertical) occupied by each contiguous segment of brown (5) cells horizontally, but only in odd columns (by 0-based index from the left).\n\nSymmetry, Patterns, and Transformations:\n- The rule for coloring is symmetric with respect to the vertical axis: if you left-right mirror the grid and then apply the same logic, you still get the correct output. This suggests that the coloring rule depends on both absolute and relative column positions.\n- For each row, in any contiguous or non-contiguous sequence, the brown cells in odd-index columns (counted from the right, not the left!) are replaced with red.

The rectangles can overlap, and overlapping follows the rule that precedence is given to original cell colors: the original color stays if non-background.\\n- Grids always show 1 (orange) rectangles tightly wrapping green (2) shapes regardless of their location or the direction (corners, center, etc.).\\n- If a green object is already adjacent to other colored objects, the bounding box can contain those o...\", \"code\": \"def solve(input_mat):\\n    import numpy as np\\n    from collections import deque\\n    H, W = len(input_mat), len(input_mat[0])\\n    output = [list(row) for row in input_mat]\\n\\n    # BFS to find all green (2) objects\\n    visited = [[False]*W for _ in range(H)]\\n    objects = []\\n    for i in range(H):\\n        for j in range(W):\\n            if input_mat[i][j] == 2 and not visited[i][j]:\\n                comp = []\\n                queue = deque()\\n                queue.append((i,j))\\n                visited[i][j] = True\\n                while queue:\\n                    x,y = queue.popleft()\\n                    comp.append((x,y))\\n                    for dx,dy in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:\\n                        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy\\n                        if 0 <= nx < H and 0 <= ny < W:\\n                            if input_mat[nx][ny] == 2 and not visited[nx][ny]:\\n                                visited[nx][ny] = True\\n                                queue.append((nx,ny))\\n                objects.append(comp)\\n\\n    for comp in objects:\\n        rows = [p[0] for p in comp]\\n        cols = [p[1] for p in comp]\\n        rmin, rmax = min(rows), max(rows)\\n        cmin, cmax = min(cols), max(cols)\\n        for r in range(rmin, rmax+1):\\n            for c in range(cmin, cmax+1):\\n                if input_mat[r][c] == 0:\\n                    output[r][c] = 1\\n    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in output)\"}"}]}

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the Images\n\nGrid Structure and Color Usage:\n- All input grids are relatively large (e.g., 16x17, 16x15, 16x19, 17x13) compared to the output, which is always a 1x1 grid – a single cell. This highlights an extreme reduction in information, with the output summarizing some property of the input grid.\n- In each input, multiple solid rectangular blocks (color fields) are formed by adjacent same-colored cells, with each block often differing from its neighbors. These blocks form a patchwork/grid within the input grid, suggesting a segmentation by color.\n- All grids use a restricted palette: in every example, there are at least four different distinctive colors (denoted by different values, e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8). Within those, one color appears to dominate an entire region/block. Some blocks are in the corners, some fill the bottom or right quadrants, etc.\n- Within some of these color blocks, isolated single cells or small islands of a contrasting color exist (e.g., a single '1' in a sea of '2's, a '2' inside a '4' region, etc.).

Examples include 10x11, 19x21, and 14x12 grids (rows x columns). This means every analysis is contained within an unchanging spatial frame.\n\nColor/Value Analysis and Roles:\n- Four distinct numerical values (and corresponding colors) are used (in their input/output roles):\n  - 0 (deep blue): forms the background in both input and output; majority of cells are this color.\n  - 3 (bright red, input only): forms all the shaped objects (lines and corners) in each input grid.\n  - 1 (orange), 2 (green), 6 (pink/purple): these three values are introduced in the output, replacing certain input 3s with new colors. No new shapes are made out of thin air.\n\nObject Properties and Positioning:\n- All non-background objects (red, value 3 in the input) are rectilinear chains or blocks. They form right-angle corners, horizontal and vertical line segments, or combination \"L\" shapes.\n- In the output, each of these red objects becomes monochromatic (filled by a single new color: orange, green, or pink), and the background remains strictly 0 (deep blue).\n\nTransformation Analysis (Comparing Input to Output):\n- Each distinct group of red (3) cells (disconnected from each other, i.e., only directly/diagonally touching cells form a group/object) is mapped to one of three output colors (1, 2, or 6).\n- No object is split, merged, or relocated—they maintain their footprint exactly.\n- Which color (from 1/orange, 2/green, 6/pink) is assigned to each object is determined by an intrinsic property of the object: its shape, size, or structure.\n- For each output, within any one grid, all objects of a given new color are the same type or fit the same shape/structural property.\n\nExplicit Patterns Across All Examples:\n- Orange (1) objects are always straight lines—either a horizontal or a vertical bar (never containing a corner or L-junction). The length of the bar varies, but the 1s are always in a single line.\n- Green (2) objects are always perfect rectangles (solid, fully filled—at least in the outputs shown here), generally forming a box shape.

No new shapes are made out of thin air.\\n\\nObject Properties and Positioning:\\n- All non-background objects (red, value 3 in the input) are rectilinear chains or blocks. They form right-angle corners, horizontal and vertical line segments, or combination \\\"L\\\" shapes.\\n- In the output, each of these red objects becomes monochromatic (filled by a single new color: orange, green, or pink), and the background remains strictly 0 (deep blue).\\n\\nTransformation Analysis (Comparing Input to Output):\\n- Each distinct group of red (3) cells (disconnected from each other, i.e., only directly/diagonally touching cells form a group/object) is mapped to one of three output colors (1, 2, or 6).\\n- No object is split, merged, or relocated—they maintain their footprint exactly.\\n- Which color (from 1/orange, 2/green, 6/pink) is assigned to each object is determined by an intrinsic property of the object: its shape, size, or structure.\\n- For each output, within any one grid, all objects of a given new color are the same type or fit the same shape/structural property.\\n\\nExplicit Patterns Across All Examples:\\n- Orange (1) objects are always straight lines—either a horizontal or a vertical bar (never containing a corner or L-junction). The length of the bar varies, but the 1s are always in a single line.\\n- Green (2) objects are always perfect rectangles (solid, fully filled—at least in the outputs shown here), generally forming a box shape. If a shape is a single unbroken filled rectangle, it's colored green.\\n- Pink (6) objects are all \\\"L\\\" shapes—disjoint from the others. That is, a pink object is comprised of two perpendicular bars joined at a corner (but not a filled rectangle).\\n- Background (originally blue/0) is unchanged througho...\", \"code\": \"def transform(input_grid):\\n    H, W = len(input_grid), len(input_grid[0])\\n    output = [list(row) for row in input_grid]\\n    def get_objects():\\n        objs, seen = [], set()\\n        for i in range(H):\\n            for j in range(W):\\n                if input_grid[i][j] == 3 and (i,j) not in seen:\\n                    obj, todo = set(), [(i,j)]\\n                    while todo:\\n                        r,c = todo.pop()\\n                        if (r,c) in seen: continue\\n                        seen.add((r,c))\\n                        obj.add((r,c))\\n                        for dr,dc in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:\\n                            nr,nc = r+dr, c+dc\\n                            if 0<=nr<H and 0<=nc<W and input_grid[nr][nc]==3 and (nr,nc) not in seen:\\n                                todo.append((nr,nc))\\n                    objs.append(obj)\\n        return objs\\n    def classify(obj):\\n        rows = set(r for r,_ in obj)\\n        cols = set(c for _,c in obj)\\n        if len(rows)==1 or len(cols)==1:\\n            return 1\\n        rmin,rmax = min(rows),max(rows)\\n        cmin,cmax = min(cols),max(cols)\\n        if all((r,c) in obj for r in range(rmin,rmax+1) for c in range(cmin,cmax+1)):\\n            return 2\\n        return 6\\n    for obj in get_objects():\\n        color = classify(obj)\\n        for (r,c) in obj:\\n            output[r][c] = color\\n    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in output)\"}"}]}

These markers are not present in the input but appear in the output in a stepped, diagonal, or straight path.\\n\\nComparisons (Input to Output):\\n- The blue clusters (0) are *never* changed between input and output: all positions that were 0 remain 0, no more nor less.\\n- The background is not altered except where overlaid by new marker values (3, 2, or 8 in outputs).\\n- The transformation is the addition of a new, colored path (red/green/yellow marker) extending from one cluster toward or into another, following a distinct direction.\\n\\nSpatial and Geometric Patterns:\\n- The blue clusters are disconnected groups—each example has two or more such clusters.\\n- The path of the new marker always connects the \\\"least common color\\\" cluster (often blue at center or corner) to another cluster of the same color, generally the one furthest away in either vertical/horizontal or diagonal direction.\\n- This path is always straight, following a line from the center of one blue cluster to the center of the other blue cluster.\\n- The marker path does not intersect any blue cell: it goes through only the background, and fills these background cells.\\n- The marker value is consistent within an example (e.g. only 3 for the first, 2 for the second, 8 for the third), and is always the least common color in the grid.\\n- The path length is bounded (never infinite, usually exactly connects cluster centers, sometimes clipped by grid edges if needed).\\n\\nSymmetry, Shape, and Directionality:\\n- No rotation or reflection occurs on the full grid; the transformation is additive and directed.\\n- The blue (0) clusters act as anchors or endpoints.\\n- The new color always fills a path between clusters, not just between arbitrary background ...\", \"code\": \"import numpy as np\\nfrom collections import Counter, deque\\n\\ndef find_connected_components(arr, value):\\n    H, W = arr.shape\\n    visited = np.zeros_like(arr, dtype=bool)\\n    clusters = []\\n    for i in range(H):\\n        for j in range(W):\\n            if arr[i,j] == value and not visited[i,j]:\\n                # BFS or DFS to find full cluster\\n                q = deque([(i,j)])\\n                cluster = []\\n                visited[i,j] = True\\n                while q:\\n                    x,y = q.popleft()\\n                    cluster.append((x,y))\\n                    for dx,dy in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:\\n                        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy\\n                        if 0<=nx<H and 0<=ny<W and arr[nx,ny]==value and not visited[nx,ny]:\\n                            q.append((nx,ny))\\n                            visited[nx,ny]=True\\n                clusters.append(cluster)\\n    return clusters\\n\\ndef compute_center(cluster):\\n    xs = [x for x,_ in cluster]\\n    ys = [y for _,y in cluster]\\n    return (int(round(sum(xs)/len(xs))), int(round(sum(ys)/len(ys))))\\n\\ndef pick_most_separated(centers):\\n    best = (centers[0],centers[1])\\n    maxd = -1\\n    for i in range(len(centers)):\\n        for j in range(i+1, len(centers)):\\n            dist = abs(centers[i][0]-centers[j][0]) + abs(centers[i][1]-centers[j][1])\\n            if dist>maxd:\\n                maxd=dist\\n                best=(centers[i],centers[j])\\n    return best\\n\\ndef bresenham(a, b):\\n    # Integer line traversal from a to b\\n    x0, y0 = a\\n    x1, y1 = b\\n    path = []\\n    dx = abs(x1 - x0)\\n    dy = abs(y1 - y0)\\n    x, y = x0, y0\\n    sx = 1 if x1 > x0 else -1\\n    sy = 1 if y1 > y0 else -1\\n    if dx >= dy:\\n        err = dx / 2.0\\n        while x != x1:\\n            path.append((x, y))\\n            err -= dy\\n            if err < 0:\\n                y += sy\\n                err += dx\\n            x += sx\\n    else:\\n        err = dy / 2.0\\n        while y != y1:\\n            path.append((x, y))\\n            err -= dx\\n            if err < 0:\\n                x += sx\\n                err += dy\\n            y += sy\\n    path.append((x1, y1))\\n    return path\\n    \\ndef solve(input_mat):\\n    arr = np.array(input_mat)\\n    # Step 1: Find least common color\\n    flat = arr.flatten()\\n    color_counts = Counter(flat)\\n    least_common = min(color_counts, key=color_counts.get)\\n    # Step 2: Find blue clusters, get their centers\\n    clusters = find_connected_components(arr, value=0)\\n    centers = [compute_center(clu) for clu in clusters]\\n    c1,c2 = pick_most_separated(centers)\\n    path = bresenham(c1,c2)\\n    # Only color non-blue cells\\n    for x,y in path:\\n        if arr[x,y] != 0:\\n            arr[x,y]=least_common\\n    return arr\"}"}]}

Always in a line, never a block in input.\n  - 2 (green): Isolated single cells in the input, positioned within blue background areas, never initially touching any yellow band.\n\nSpatial Patterns and Relationships:\n- Yellow lines can occur both vertically and horizontally.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nGeneral Grid Composition:\n- All shown grids are 10x10 in size across all input-output pairs (though the solution is generalizable).\n- Three unique color/value codes are visible: 0 (deep blue), 2 (green), and 9 (light blue/cyan).\n\nColor, Shape, and Distribution:\n- The color 2 (green) forms contiguous blocks—L-shaped, rectangular, or more irregularly-shaped clusters. In each example, the green patches border the blue (0) regions and partition the grid into sections.\n- The 0 (deep blue) value is the default background and often occupies the largest region, especially inside and outside the green blocks.\n- The value 9 (light blue/cyan) is absent in the inputs and only appears in the outputs, never on the axes/border, and always as part of a horizontal or vertical line forming a bridge through an otherwise blue (0) region.\n\nComparing Input and Output:\n- The overall shape and location of the green (2) regions are preserved from input to output: there is never any erosion, growth, or translation of these blocks.\n- The 0 (deep blue) region, however, can have blocks of 9 (cyan) introduced at specific locations, always as a contiguous line (either horizontal or vertical, never two-dimensional).\n- The placement of this cyan (9) line always sits exactly between two opposite green patches, passing ONLY through the blue (0) and NOT overwriting existing green (2).\n\nPatterns, Symmetry, and Spatial Reasoning:\n- Cyan lines appear only where two green (2) cells face each other directly, with a rectangular gap between them filled by blue (0) and with no other green blocking a straight shorted path. These cyan lines fill the shortest possible bridge of 0's directly connecting two groups of greens.\n- These lines always adhere to rectilinear axes: purely horizontal or vertical.

In each example, the green patches border the blue (0) regions and partition the grid into sections.\\n- The 0 (deep blue) value is the default background and often occupies the largest region, especially inside and outside the green blocks.\\n- The value 9 (light blue/cyan) is absent in the inputs and only appears in the outputs, never on the axes/border, and always as part of a horizontal or vertical line forming a bridge through an otherwise blue (0) region.\\n\\nComparing Input and Output:\\n- The overall shape and location of the green (2) regions are preserved from input to output: there is never any erosion, growth, or translation of these blocks.\\n- The 0 (deep blue) region, however, can have blocks of 9 (cyan) introduced at specific locations, always as a contiguous line (either horizontal or vertical, never two-dimensional).\\n- The placement of this cyan (9) line always sits exactly between two opposite green patches, passing ONLY through the blue (0) and NOT overwriting existing green (2).\\n\\nPatterns, Symmetry, and Spatial Reasoning:\\n- Cyan lines appear only where two green (2) cells face each other directly, with a rectangular gap between them filled by blue (0) and with no other green blocking a straight shorted path.

{"explanation": "PART 1: Understanding the images\n\nGeneral Structure and Elements:\n- Every grid (input/output) is a 15x15 square. No resizing, cropping, or expansion occurs.\n- The background is a uniform blue color (digit 0), completely filling all outer (unstructured) space. Blue acts as the padding and remains unaltered.\n\nKey Colors/Roles:\n- Green (digit 2): Always forms horizontally and/or vertically aligned 'L' or inverted-'L' shaped blocks, or rectangles. These shapes are contiguous and never isolated.\n- Red/Brown (digit 5): Forms compact, orthogonally connected shapes inside/alongside the green 'L' blocks but never outside them. 5-regions cluster to form contiguous units—either near the horizontal or vertical arms of the 'L's or sometimes crossing the center.\n- Blue (digit 0): As noted, the background, and never changes between input and output.\n\nComparing Input vs Output (all examples):\n- The green (2) blocks remain unchanged in both type, position, and extent from input to output.\n- The red (5) shapes undergo a significant transformation:\n  - In input: 5's are embedded or enclosed within the green 'L' objects.\n  - In output: No 5's are inside the green blocks; rather, the 5's are duplicated, mirrored, or shifted to appear *outside* the green shapes. Their arrangement and orientation in output depend on the layout of the green block. All original 5's within the green region are erased (converted to 0—background), and new 5's appear in clear symmetric or mirrored positions outside the L-shape.\n- No additional digit or color is introduced.\n\nTransformational Summary:\n- The objects being transformed are:\n   1.
